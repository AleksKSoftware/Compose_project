# Sytac open assignment

The time has come for us to unveil the code challenge Sytac has prepared for you. The challenge involves working with two files, "countries" and "population", and it includes the following tasks:

### Tasks
1. Provide an application which shows the content of the two files merged, the app should show a list of all the countries together with their population.
2. Show the total number of countries.
3. Make posible to sort the list by country name or by population. â€¨


### Requisites:
- The project has to compile without errors.
- The code should be clean, efficient and understandable. Remember to
structure your source code correctly (using a nice architecture would
make this easier).
- Keep in mind the performance of the application.
- Use version control in the project to show your progress, commit like you
would normally.

If you have any technical issue or problem send me an email
